## The Most Challenging Task

If more time was available, there are several additional features and improvements that could be implemented in this project:

- More background jobs could be used to improve performance.
- More design patterns could be implemented to make the code more modular and maintainable.
- Raw SQL queries could be explored and utilized in cases where they may be more efficient than using ActiveRecord for database interactions.
- More detailed reports could be created to allow users to analyze their data more thoroughly.
- The bonus tasks listed in the project requirements could be completed.

Overall, there are many areas where the functionality of the project could be expanded and improved with more time. These areas could be explored more thoroughly to create an even more robust and user-friendly application.
